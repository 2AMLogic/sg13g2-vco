# Self-test for check-signoff.sh — a drift checker that cannot fail is
# indistinguishable from no checker at all (same rationale as the hygiene
# self-test convention in 2AMLogic/sg13g2-bandgap): before trusting the
# checker's verdict on the real tree, prove it still rejects each defect
# class it exists to catch.
#
# Cases (each in a throwaway copy of signoff/, never the real tree):
#   1. pristine copy               -> check-signoff.sh passes
#   2. tampered committed record   -> check-signoff.sh FAILS (drift gate)
#   3. tampered vendored tiers doc -> check-signoff.sh FAILS (drift gate)
#   4. broken manifest JSON        -> check-signoff.sh FAILS (runs-clean gate)
